<h3 id="abilities-awareness">Abilities Awareness</h3>

<p>In keeping with Blue Hills’ mission of educating students to respect diversity, this program’s goal is to spread awareness among our students about children with special challenges.  This program aims to promote understanding, acceptance, and appreciation of individual learning and ability differences through fun, experiential activities.</p>

<p>We will be holding the following events:</p>

<p>Abilities Awareness Day is an event that focuses on promoting better understanding of our children’s different abilities and how we can all help one another.</p>

<p>Bobcat Buddies normally occur on Tuesdays where “big” buddies and their “little” buddies eat lunch and play games together.</p>

<p>In addition, we also have Bobcat Buddies Games Days on the last Tuesday of the month with facilitated games lead by parent volunteers.</p>

<p>Please check the school bulletin or the Abilities Awareness website for latest updates.</p>

<h3 id="bobcat-bes-liaison">Bobcat Be’s Liaison</h3>

<p>The responsibilities of the Bobcat Be’s Liaison is to represent the PTA at the Bobcat Be’s meetings with the staff and to assist with the coordination of the reward activities.</p>

<p>Blue Hills’ Bobcat Be’s Student Management program supports all students through interventions ranging from a school-wide system to a system for developing individualized plans for specific students. The Bobcat Be’s program consists of pro-active procedures and practices to prevent problem behavior for all students and to improve school climate.  The Bobcat Be’s are three rules that students follow at all times at Blue Hills:  Be Safe, Be Responsible, &amp; Be Respectful.  The Bobcat Be’s uses the school-wide rules to identify specific behavioral expectations across all school settings.</p>

<p>The Bobcat Be’s: Positive and Negative Reinforcement - Students receive positive reinforcement for following the Bobcat Be’s by receiving “Paws for Praise” tickets.  Weekly classroom drawings are done for students that receive “Paws for Praise” tickets and students are recognized at weekly Bobcat Be’s assemblies.  “Paws for Praise” tickets are used to buy items at our school store: the Bobcat Den.  When students violate the Bobcat Be’s, staff intervenes to inform the student of the problem behavior, teach the appropriate behavior for the particular situation, and administer appropriate disciplinary action.</p>
