## Announcements

### Important Evening Events

Please join us in the Blue Hills GLC for two important events in the upcoming weeks.  Wednesday, January 10, at 6 p.m. is the first Blue Hills Parent Education Night, coordinated by our principal, Mrs. Prouse. Acknowledge Alliance will facilitate a conversation centered on how resiliency and social emotional wellness contribute to the overall success and happiness of students, teachers, and families.  You will walk away with a deeper understanding o SEI (Social Emotional Intelligence) and tips to foster family connectedness.  Childcare will be provided for school-aged children.

Next week, on Thursday, January 18, the new CUSD superintendent, Dr. Baker, will be speaking to the Blue Hills community at 6:30 p.m.  Come hear about his vision for Blue Hills.  It's also an opportunity for you to provide him with input.  Don't miss this opportunity!

### Happy Holidays, Blue Hills Family!

Wishing you all the very best for the holiday season and in the new year!

### Holiday Gift Drive for Senior Citizens

Come join the Blue Hills Community Service team in our mission to make this holiday season memorable for the seniors at our local Our Lady of Fatima Villa!  If you would like to participate in spreading some holiday cheer to an often overlooked group in our community, please see [here](/assets/forms/CommunityService-GiftDrive.pdf) for more details.

### Candy!

Thank you, Blue Hills community, for making the first ever Blue Hills PTA/BHEF Trunk or Treat Event a resounding success!  We had a fantastic turnout, and it was so great to see all the creativity on display (by both kids and trunk hosts!).  Don't forget, if you have more candy now than you know what to do with, the K-Kids will be collecting individually wrapped candy to support Operation Care and Comfort.  Bring that candy to school and donate it to a good cause!

### Trunk or Treat!

After school on October 31, please join us for the first ever Blue Hills PTA Trunk or Treat event!  [We will be closing off the Blue Hills parking lot](/assets/forms/PickUpMap-TrunkOrTreat.pdf) so that students can visit volunteer "trunks" to receive their Halloween treats!  You can find more information about the event [here](/assets/forms/Trunk%20or%20Treat%20Friday%20Folder.pdf).

### Show Us Your Super Hero Powers!  Walk, Volunteer, Donate!

The Bobcat Walk is almost upon us!  This year's Walk-A-Thon event will be held on Friday, October 20, during school hours.  Please support Blue Hills kids by volunteering and donating!  Donation pledge forms were sent home in student Friday folders, and can also be found [here](http://www.bluehillspta.org/assets/forms/Bobcat%20Walk%20Pledge%20Form%202017.pdf).  You can find more information about the Bobcat Walk [here](http://www.bluehillspta.org/assets/forms/Bobcat%20Walk%20Details.pdf).  The Bobcat Walk is one of the PTA's biggest fundraisers, and we rely on you to help us fund the [enrichment programs](http://www.bluehillspta.org/programs) that help our kids learn and grow!

### Help Keep Our Kids Safe! 

Blue Hills is in need of people to help out during the lunch hour. Noon Duty Supervisors help students open and eat their lunches and also help supervise the play time. People can sign up to work once per week or everyday for one hour, 11:25-12:25.  There are paid positions as well as volunteer positions. Please contact Audrey Prouse at  prouse_audrey@cusdk8.org if you are interested in more information. Thank you!

### Book Fair is Here!
